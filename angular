npm install --save bootstrap@4.0.0-beta.2 font-awesome

Now that we have the dependencies in place, we can tell Angular CLI that it needs to load these styles by opening the file src/styles.css and adding the following two statements.

@import "~bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css";
@import "~font-awesome/css/font-awesome.css";
